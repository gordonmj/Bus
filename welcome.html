<h2>Welcome to my NJ Bus Time dashboard.</h2>
<p>If you're like me* you might have several bus options in the morning, but not necessarily all at the same stop.</p>
<p>NJ Transit provides semi-accurate up-to-the-minute bus times, but it can be annoying to switch between pages for different stops, or wait for an SMS alert.</p>
<p>That's why I put this together. Currently, you can <a href="DIY.php">make your own "dashboard"</a> with three stops on a single page.</p>
<p>More functionality to come later.</p>
<p>You can find buses from central Teaneck to New York <a href="ToNY.php">here</a>.</p>
